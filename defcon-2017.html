    <h2 class="talkTitle">Untrustworthy Hardware and How to Fix It</h2>
      <p class="speaker">0ctane, Hacker</p>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 10:00 in Track 4 -- 20 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="abstract">Modern computing platforms offer more freedom than ever before. The rise of Free and Open Source Software has led to more secure and heavily scrutinized cryptographic solutions. However, below the surface of open source operating systems, strictly closed source firmware along with device driver blobs and closed system architecture prevent users from examining, understanding, and trusting the systems where they run their private computations. Embedded technologies like Intel Management Engine pose significant threats when, not if, they get exploited. Advanced attackers in possession of firmware signing keys, and even potential access to chip fabrication, could wreak untold havoc on cryptographic devices we rely on.<br><br>
      After surveying all-too-possible low level attacks on critical systems, we will introduce an alternative open source solution to peace-of-mind cryptography and private computing. By using programmable logic chips, called Field Programmable Gate Arrays, this device is more open source than any common personal computing system to date. No blobs, no hidden firmware features, and no secret closed source processors. This concept isn't "unhacakable", rather we believe it to be the most fixable; this is what users and hackers should ultimately be fighting for.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">0ctane is a longtime hobbyist hacker, with experience primarily in UNIX systems and hardware. Holding no official training or technical employment, 0ctane spends most of their free time building and restoring older computer systems, hanging out at surplus stores and tracking down X86 alternatives with an occasional dabbling in OSX and 802.11 exploitation. Other interests include SDR and RF exploration, networking, cryptography, computer history, distributed computing...really anything that sounds cool that I happen to stumble on at 3am.</p>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Evading next-gen AV using artificial intelligence</h2>
      <p class="speaker">Hyrum Anderson, Technical Director of Data Science, Endgame</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 11:00 in Track 4 -- 20 minutes | Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">Much of next-gen AV relies on machine learning to generalize to never-before-seen malware. Less well appreciated, however, is that machine learning can be susceptible to attack by, ironically, other machine learning models. In this talk, we demonstrate an AI agent trained through reinforcement learning to modify malware to evade machine learning malware detection. Reinforcement learning has produced game-changing AI's that top human level performance in the game of Go and a myriad of hacked retro Atari games (e.g., Pong). In an analogous fashion, we demonstrate an AI agent that has learned through thousands of "games" against a next-gen AV malware detector which sequence of functionality-preserving changes to perform on a Windows PE malware file so that it bypasses the detector. No math or machine learning background is required; fundamental understanding of malware and Windows PE files is a welcome; and previous experience hacking Atari Pong is a plus.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">Hyrum Anderson is technical director of data scientist at Endgame, where he leads research on detecting adversaries and their tools using machine learning.  Prior to joining Endgame he conducted information security and situational awareness research as a researcher at FireEye, Mandiant, Sandia National Laboratories and MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Dealing the perfect hand - Shuffling memory blocks on z/OS</h2>
      <p class="speaker">Ayoul3, Pentester, Wavestone</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 16:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="abstract">Follow me on a journey where we p0wn one of the most secure platforms on earth. A giant mammoth that still powers the most critical business functions around the world: The Mainframe! Be it a wire transfer, an ATM withdrawal, or a flight booking, you can be sure that you've used the trusted services of a Mainframe at least once during the last 24 hours. In this talk, I will present methods of privilege escalation on IBM z/OS: How to leverage a simple access to achieve total control over the machine and impersonate other users. If you are interested in mainframes or merely curious to see a what a shell looks like on MVS, you're welcome to tag along.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">Ayoub is a pentester working for Wavestone, a consulting firm based in France. He got interested in Mainframe security in 2014 when, during an audit, he noticed the big security gap between this platform and standard systems like Windows and Unix. A gap that makes little sense since z/OS has been around for a while and is used by most major companies to perform critical business operations: wire transfer, claim refunds, bookings, etc.<br>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">BITSInject</h2>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 10:20 in Track 3 -- 20 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="speaker">Dor Azouri, Security researcher, @SafeBreach</p>
      <p class="abstract">Windows' BITS service is a middleman for your download jobs. You start a BITS job, and from that point on, BITS is responsible for the download. But what if we tell you that BITS is a careless middleman? We have uncovered the way BITS maintains its jobs queue using a state file on disk, and found a way for a local administrator to control jobs using special modifications to that file<br><br>
      Comprehending this file's binary structure allowed us to change a job's properties (such as RemoteURL, Destination Path...) in runtime and even inject our own custom job, using none of BITS' public interfaces. This method, combined with the generous notification feature of BITS, allowed us to run a program of our will as the LocalSystem account, within session 0. So if you wish to execute your code as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM and the first options that come to mind are psexec/creating a service, we now add a new option: BITSInject.<br><br>
      Here, we will not only introduce the practical method we formed, but also: Reveal the binary structure of the state file for you to play with, and some knowledge we gathered while researching the service flow<br><br>
      We will also provide free giveaways: A one-click python tool that performs the described method; SimpleBITSServer - a pythonic BITS server; A struct definition file, to use for parsing your BITS state file</p>

      <p class="speaker">Avi Bashan, Mobile R&amp;D Team Leader, Check Point</p>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 10:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="speaker">Slava Makkaveev, Security Researcher, Check Point</p>
      <p class="abstract">To understand the Android ecosystem today, one must understand Android packers. Whether used for protecting legitimate apps' business logic or hiding malicious content, Android packer usage is on the rise. Android packers continue to increase their efforts to prevent reverse engineers and static analysis engines from understanding what's inside the package. To do so they employ elaborate tactics, including state of the art ELF tampering, obfuscation and various anti-debugging techniques.<br><br>
      In this talk, we will provide an overview of the packer industry and present real world test cases. We will do a deep technical dive into the internal workings of popular Android packers, exposing the different methods which protect the app's code. As a countermeasure, we will provide various techniques to circumvent them, allowing hackers and security researchers to unpack the secrets they withhold.</p>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Microservices and FaaS for Offensive Security</h2>
      <p class="speaker">Ryan Baxendale</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 11:00 in 101 Track -- 20 minutes | Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">There are more cloud service providers offering serverless or Function-as-a-service platforms for quickly deploying and scaling applications without the need for dedicated server instances and the overhead of system administration. This technical talk will cover the basic concepts of microservices and FaaS, and how to use them to scale time consuming offensive security testing tasks. Attacks that were previously considered impractical due to time and resource constraints can now be considered feasible with the availability of cloud services and the never-ending free flow of public IP addresses to avoid attribution and blacklists.<br><br>
      Key takeaways include a guide to scaling your tools and a demonstration on the practical benefits of utilising cloud services in performing undetected port scans, opportunistic attacks against short lived network services, brute-force attacks on services and OTP values, and creating your own whois database, shodan/censys, and searching for the elusive internet accessible IPv6 hosts.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">Ryan Baxendale works as a penetration tester in Singapore where he leads a team of professional hackers. While his day is filled mainly with web and mobile penetration tests, he is more interested developing security tools, discovering IPv6 networks, and mining the internet for targeted low hanging fruit.

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Jailbreaking Apple Watch</h2>
      <p class="speaker">Max Bazaliy, Security Researcher, Lookout</p>
      <p class="datetime">Thursday at 12:00 in 101 Track 2 -- 45 minutes | Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">On April 24, 2015, Apple launched themselves into the wearables category with the introduction of Apple Watch. This June, at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple announced that their watch is not only the #1 selling smartwatch worldwide by far, but also announced the introduction of new capabilities that will come with the release of watchOS 4. Like other devices, Apple Watch contains highly sensitive user data such as email and text messages, contacts, GPS and more, and like other devices and operating systems, has become a target for malicious activity.<br><br>
      This talk will provide an overview of Apple Watch and watchOS security mechanisms including codesign enforcement, sandboxing, memory protections and more. We will cover vulnerabilities and exploitation details and dive into the techniques used in creating an Apple Watch jailbreak.

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Starting the Avalanche: Application DoS In Microservice Architectures</h2>
      <p class="speaker">Scott Behrens, Senior Application Security Engineer</p>
      <p class="datetime">Friday at 13:00 in Track 3 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="speaker">Jeremy Heffner, Senior Cloud Security Engineer</p>
      <p class="abstract">We'd like to introduce you to one of the most devastating ways to cause service instability in modern micro-service architectures: application DDoS. Unlike traditional network DDoS that focuses on network pipes and edge resources, our talk focuses on identifying and targeting expensive calls within a micro-services architecture, using their complex interconnected relationships to cause the system to attack itself — with massive effect. In modern microservice architectures it's easier to cause service instability with sophisticated requests that model legitimate traffic to pass right through web application firewalls.<br><br>
      We will discuss how the Netflix application security team identified areas of our microservices that laid the groundwork for these exponential-work attacks. We'll step through one case study of how a single request into an API endpoint fans out through the application fabric and results in an exponential set of dependent service calls. Disrupting even one point within the dependency graph can have a cascading effect throughout not only the initial endpoint, but the dependent services backing other related API services.<br><br>
      We will then discuss the frameworks we collaborated on building that refine the automation and reproducibility of testing the endpoints, which we've already successfully leveraged against our live production environment. We will provide a demonstration of the frameworks which will be open sourced in conjunction with this presentation. Attendees will leave this talk understanding architectural and technical approaches to identify and remediate application DDoS vulnerabilities within their own applications. Attendees will also gain a greater understanding on how take a novel new attack methodology and build an orchestration framework that can be used at a global scale.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">Scott Behrens is currently employed as a senior application security engineer for Netflix. Prior to Netflix Scott worked as a senior security consultant at Neohapsis and an adjunct professor at DePaul University. Scott's expertise lies in both building and breaking for application security at scale. As an avid coder and researcher, he has contributed to and released a number of open source tools for both attack and defense. Scott has presented security research at DEF CON, DerbyCon, OWASP AppSec USA, Shmoocon, Shakacon, Security Forum Hagenberg, Security B-sides Chicago, and others.<br>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">The call is coming from inside the house! Are you ready for the next evolution in DDoS attacks?</h2>
      <p class="speaker">Steinthor Bjarnason, Senior Network Security Analyst, Arbor Networks</p>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 12:00 in Track 3 -- 45 minutes | Art of Defense</p>
      <p class="speaker">Jason Jones, Security Architect, Arbor Networks</p>
      <p class="abstract">The second half of 2016 saw the rise of a new generation of IoT botnets consisting of webcams and other IoT devices. These botnets were then subsequently used to launch DDoS attacks on an unprecedented scale against Olympic-affiliated organizations, OVH, the web site of Brian Krebs and Dyn.<br><br>
      Early 2017, a multi-stage Windows Trojan containing code to scan for vulnerable IoT devices and inject them with Mirai bot code was discovered. The number of IoT devices which were previously safely hidden inside corporate perimeters, vastly exceeds those directly accessible from the Internet, allowing for the creation of botnets with unprecedented reach and scale.<br><br>
      This reveals an evolution in the threat landscape that most organizations are completely unprepared to deal with and will require a fundamental shift in how we defend against DDoS attacks.<br><br>
      This presentation will include:<br>- An analysis of the Windows Mirai seeder including its design, history, infection vectors and potential evolution.<br>- The DDoS capabilities of typically infected IoT devices including malicious traffic analysis.<br>- The consequences of infected IoT devices inside the corporate network including the impact of DDoS attacks, originating from the inside, targeting corporate assets and external resources.<br>- How to detect, classify and mitigate this new threat.</p>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Abusing Certificate Transparency Logs</h2>
      <p class="datetime">Friday  at 15:00 in Track 4 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="speaker">Hanno B&ouml;ck, Hacker and freelance journalist</p>
      <p class="abstract">The Certificate Transparency system provides public logs of TLS certificates. While Certificate Transparency is primarily used to uncover security issues in certificates, its data is also valuable for other use cases. The talk will present a novel way of exploiting common web applications like Wordpress, Joomla or Typo3 with the help of Certificate Transparency.<br><br>
      Certificate Transparency has helped uncover various incidents in the past where certificate authorities have violated rules. It is probably one of the most important security improvements that has ever happened in the certificate authority ecosystem. In September 2017 Google will make Certificate Transparency mandatory for all new certificates. So it's a good time to see how it could be abused by the bad guys.</p>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Revoke-Obfuscation: PowerShell Obfuscation Detection (And Evasion) Using Science </h2>
      <p class="speaker">Daniel Bohannon (DBO), Senior Consultant, MANDIANT</p>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 13:00 in Track 4 -- 45 minutes | Art of Defense, Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="speaker">Lee Holmes, Lead Security Architect, Microsoft</p>
      <p class="abstract">Attackers, administrators and many legitimate products rely on PowerShell for their core functionality. However, its power has made it increasingly attractive for attackers and commodity malware authors alike. How do you separate the good from the bad?<br><br>
      A/V signatures applied to command line arguments work sometimes. AMSI-based (Anti-malware Scan Interface) detection performs significantly better. But obfuscation and evasion techniques like Invoke-Obfuscation can and do bypass both approaches.<br><br>
      Revoke-Obfuscation is a framework that transforms evasion into a treacherous deceit. By applying a suite of unique statistical analysis techniques against PowerShell scripts and their structures, what was once a cloak of invisibility is now a spotlight. It works with .evtx files, command lines, scripts, ScriptBlock logs, Module logs, and is easy to extend.<br><br>
      Approaches for evading these detection techniques will be discussed and demonstrated.<br><br>
      Revoke-Obfuscation has been used in numerous Mandiant investigations to successfully identify obfuscated and non-obfuscated malicious PowerShell scripts and commands. It also detects all obfuscation techniques in Invoke-Obfuscation, including two new techniques being released with this presentation.<br><br>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Game of Drones: Putting the Emerging "Drone Defense" Market to the Test</h2>
      <p class="speaker">Francis Brown, Partner, Bishop Fox </p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 16:00 in Track 4 -- 45 minutes | Art of Defense, Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="speaker">David Latimer, Security Analyst, Bishop Fox </p>
      <p class="abstract">When you learned that military and law enforcement agencies had trained screaming eagles to pluck drones from the sky, did you too find yourself asking: "I wonder if I could throw these eagles off my tail, maybe by deploying delicious bacon countermeasures?"  Well you'd be wise to question just how effective these emerging, first generation "drone defense" solutions really are, and which amount to little more than "snake oil".<br><br>
       There is no such thing as "best practices" when it comes to defending against "rogue drones", period. Over the past 2 years, new defensive products that detect and respond to "rogue drones" have been crawling out of the woodwork. The vast majority are immature, unproven solutions that require a proper vetting.<br><br>
       We've taken a MythBusters-style approach to testing the effectiveness of a variety of drone defense solutions, pitting them against our DangerDrone. Videos demonstrating the results should be almost as fun for you to watch as they were for us to produce. Expect to witness epic aerial battles against an assortment of drone defense types, including:<br><br>
       - trained eagles and falcons that hunt "rogue drones" <br>
       - fighter drones that hunt and shoot nets <br>
       - drones with large nets that swoop in and snatch up 'rogue drones' <br>
       - surface-to-air projectile weapons, including bazooka-like cannons that launch nets, and shotgun shells containing nets <br>
       - signal jamming and hijacking devices that attack drone command and control interfaces <br>
       - even frickin' laser beams and Patriot missiles! <br><br>
       We'll also be releasing DangerDrone v2.0, an upgraded version of our free Raspberry Pi-based pentesting quadcopter (basically a ~$500 hacker's laptop, that can also fly). We'll be giving away a fully functional DangerDrone v2.0 to one lucky audience member!
       So come see what's guaranteed to be the most entertaining talk this year and find out which of these dogs can hunt!</p>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">How we created the first SHA-1 collision and what it means for hash security</h2>
      <p class="datetime">Friday at 14:00 in Track 4 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="speaker">Elie Bursztein, Anti-abuse research lead, Google</p>
      <p class="abstract">In February 2017, we announced the first SHA-1 collision. This collision combined with a clever use of the PDF format allows attackers to forge PDF pairs that have identical SHA-1 hashes and yet display different content. This attack is the result of over two years of intense research. It took 6500 CPU years and 110 GPU years of computations which is still 100,000 times faster than a brute-force attack.<br><br>
      In this talk, we recount how we found the first SHA-1 collision. We delve into the challenges we faced from developing a meaningful payload, to scaling the computation to that massive scale, to solving unexpected cryptanalytic challenges that occurred during this endeavor.<br><br>
      We discuss the aftermath of the release including the positive changes it brought and its unforeseen consequences. For example it was discovered that SVN is vulnerable to SHA-1 collision attacks only after the WebKit SVN repository was brought down by the commit of a unit-test aimed at verifying that Webkit is immune to collision attacks.<br><br>
      Building on the Github and Gmail examples we explain how to use counter-cryptanalysis to mitigate the risk of a collision attacks against software that has yet to move away from SHA-1. Finally we look at the next generation of hash functions and what the future of hash security holds</p>

      <p class="speaker">Nick Cano, Hacker</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 14:00 in Track 4 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="abstract">XenoScan is the next generation in tooling for hardcore game hackers. Building on the solid foundation from older tools like Cheat Engine and Tsearch, XenoScan makes many innovations which take memory scanning to a whole new level.<br><br>
      This demo-heavy talk will skip the fluff and show the power of the tool in real-time. The talk will demonstrate how the tool can scan for partial structures, detect complex data structures such as binary trees or linked lists, detect class-instances living on the heap, and even group detected class instances by their types. Additional, these demos will take a look at the tool's extensibility by working not only on native processes, but also on Nintendo games running in emulators. You're not all game hackers, so the talk will also show how XenoScan can be useful in the day-to-day workflow of reverse engineers and hackers.<br><br>
      When I'm not doing demos, I'll be drilling down to the low-level to talk about the nitty gritty details of what's happening, how it works, and why it works.<br><br>
      By the end of the talk, you'll see the true power of a well-made, smart memory scanner. You'll be empowered to use it in your day to day hacking, whether that is on games, malware, or otherwise. For those of you that are really interested in the tool, it is completely open-source and all development is done on an interactive livestream, meaning you can participate in and learn from future development.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Damien "virtualabs" Cauquil, Senior security researcher, Econocom Digital Security</p>
      <p class="datetime">Friday at 11:00 in Track 2 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit</p>
      <p class="abstract">In 2015, BBC sponsored Micro:Bit was launched and offered to one million students in the United Kingdom to teach them how to code. This device is affordable and have a lot of features and can be programmed in Python rather than C++ like the Arduino. When we discovered this initiative in 2016, we quickly thought it was possible to turn this tiny device into some kind of super-duper portable wireless attack tool, as it is based on a well-known 2.4GHz RF chip produced by Nordic Semiconductor.<br><br>
      It took us a few months to hack into the Micro:Bit firmware and turn it into a powerful attack tool able to sniff keystrokes from wireless keyboards or to hijack and take complete control of quadcopters during flight. We also developed many tools allowing security researchers to interact with proprietary 2.4GHz protocols, such as an improved sniffer inspired by the mousejack tools designed by Bastille. We will release the source code of our firmware and related tools during the conference.<br><br>

      <p class="speaker">chaosdata, Senior Security Consultant, NCC Group</p>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 10:20 in Track 4 -- 20 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="abstract">Modern Android applications are large and complex, and can be a pain to analyze even without obfuscation - static analysis can only get one so far, the debugger sucks, Frida doesn't give you enough access to the Java environment, and editing smali or writing Xposed hooks can be time consuming and error prone. There has to be a better way!<br><br>
      What if we could inject a command line REPL into an app to drive functionality? And what if we could also make writing function hooks fast and easy?<br><br>
      In this talk, I will introduce ParaSpectre, a platform for dynamic analysis of Android applications that injects JRuby into Android applications. It bundles a hook configuration web API, a web application interface to configure and edit hooks, and a connect-back JRuby REPL to aid application exploration from the inside-out. It supports various selectors to match classes and methods, can be reconfigured on-the-fly without requiring a device reboot, and takes the pain out of writing method hooks for Android apps.<br><br>
      ParaSpectre is for developers and security researchers alike. While not itself a debugger, it provides a level of access into a running application that a debugger generally won't.</p>

      <p class="abstract">You are performing a pentest. You just owned the first domain controller. That was easy. All the computers are belong to you. But unfortunately, you can't reach the final goal. The last target is further in the network, non accessible and heavily filtered. Thankfully, one last hope remains. You realize the target domain pulls its updates from the WSUS server of the compromised domain, the one you fully control. Hope is back... But once again, it fails. The only tools available for controlling the updates are not working: they require a network attack that is prevented by the network architecture and the server configuration. All hope is lost...<br><br>
      We will present you a new approach, allowing you to circumvent these limitations and to exploit this situation in order to deliver updates. Thus, you will be able to control the targeted network from the very WSUS server you own. By extension, this approach may serve as a basis for an air gap attack for disconnected networks.<br><br>
      Our talk will describe vulnerable architectures to this approach and also make some in-context demonstration of the attack with new public tooling. Finally, as nothing is inescapable, we will also explain how you can protect your update architecture.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Chris Quartier, Embedded Engineer, Cryptotronix, LLC</p>
      <p class="abstract">The security of your bitcoins rests entirely in the security of your private key. Bitcoin hardware wallets help protect against software-based attacks to recover or misuse your key. However, hardware attacks on these wallets are not as well studied. In 2015, Jochen Hoenicke was able to extract the private key from a TREZOR using a simple power analysis technique. While that vulnerability was patched, he suggested the Microcontroller on the TREZOR, which is also the same on the KeepKey, may be vulnerable to additional side channel attacks.<br><br>
      In this presentation we will quickly overview fault injection techniques, timing, and power analysis methods using the Open Source Hardware tool, the ChipWhisperer. We then show how to apply these techniques to the STM32F205 which is the MCU on the Trezor and KeepKey. Lastly, we will present our findings of a timing attack vulnerability and conclude with software and hardware recommendations to improve bitcoin hardware wallets. We will show and share our tools and methods to help you get started in breaking your own wallet!</p>

      <p class="speaker">Sean Dillon (zerosum0x0), Senior Security Analyst, RiskSense, Inc.</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 13:00 in Track 2 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="speaker">Zach Harding (Aleph-Naught-), Senior Security Analyst, RiskSense, Inc.</p>
      <p class="abstract">Koadic C3, or COM Command &amp; Control, is a Windows post-exploitation tool similar to other penetration testing rootkits such as Meterpreter and Powershell Empire. The major difference is that Koadic does most of its operations using the Windows Script Host (a.k.a. JScript/VBScript), with compatibility in the core to support a default installation of Windows 2000 with no service packs (and potentially even versions of NT4) all the way through Windows 10.<br><br>
      An in-depth view of default COM objects will be provided. COM is a fairly underexplored, large attack surface in Windows. We will share lots of weird Windows scripting quirks with interesting workarounds we discovered during the course of development. Post exploitation with PowerShell has grown in popularity in recent years, and seeing what can be done with just the basic Windows Script Host is an interesting exploration. In addition, defenses against this type of tool will be discussed, as the Windows Script Host is more tightly coupled to the core of Windows than PowerShell is.<br><br>
      It is possible to serve payloads completely in memory from stage 0 to beyond, as well as use cryptographically secure communications over SSL and TLS (depending on what the victim OS has available). We also found numerous ways to "fork to shellcode" in an environment which traditionally does not provide such capabilities. This talk is based on original research by ourselves, as well as the previous amazing work of engima0x3, subTee, tiraniddo, and others.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Roger Dingledine, The Tor Project</p>
      <p class="datetime">Friday at 13:00 in Track 4 -- 45 minutes | 0025</p>
      <p class="abstract">Millions of people around the world use Tor every day to protect themselves from surveillance and censorship. While most people use Tor to reach ordinary websites more safely, a tiny fraction of Tor traffic makes up what overhyped journalists like to call the "dark web". Tor onion services (formerly known as Tor hidden services) let people run Internet services such as websites in a way where both the service and the people reaching it can get stronger security and privacy.<br><br>
      I wrote the original onion service code as a toy example in 2004, and it sure is showing its age. In particular, mistakes in the original protocol are now being actively exploited by fear-mongering "threat intelligence" companies to build lists of onion services even when the service operators thought they would stay under the radar.<br><br>
      These design flaws are a problem because people rely on onion services for many cool use cases, like metadata-free chat and file sharing, safe interaction between journalists and their sources, safe software updates, and more secure ways to reach popular websites like Facebook.<br><br>
      In this talk I'll present our new and improved onion service design, which provides stronger security and better scalability. I'll also publish a new release of the Tor software that lets people use the new design.</p>

      <p class="abstract">A judge with preferences for hard core porn, a police officer investigating a cyber-crime, a politician ordering burn out medication - this kind of very personal and private information is on the market. Get sold to who is willing to pay for.<br><br>
      In a long time experiment, with the help of some social engineering techniques, we were able to get our hands on the most private data you can find on the internet. Click stream data of three million German citizens. They contain every URL they have looked at, every second, every hour, every day for 31 days. In our talk we will not only show how we got that data, but how you can de-anonymize it with some simple techniques.<br><br>
      This data is collected worldwide by big companies, whose legal purpose is to sell analytics and insights for marketers and businesses. In the shadow of Google and Facebook, companies have evolved, their names unknown to a broader public but making billions of dollars with your data. The new oil of the 20th century.<br><br>
      Our experiment shows in a drastic way, what the youngest decision reversing the Broadband Privacy Rule means. What the consequences for everyday life could be, when ISPs are allowed to sell your browsing data. And why that piece of regulation from the FCC was so important regarding privacy and constitutional rights.</p>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Attacking Autonomic Networks</h2>
      <p class="speaker">Omar Eissa, Security Analyst, ERNW GmbH</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 14:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Demo, Exploit</p>
      <p class="abstract">Autonomic systems are smart systems which do not need any human management or intervention. Cisco is one of the first companies to deploy the technology in which the routers are just "Plug and Play" with no need for configuration. All that is needed is 5 commands to build fully automated network. It is already supported in pretty much all of the recent software images for enterprise level and carrier grade routers/switches.<br><br>
      This is the bright side of the technology. On the other hand, the configuration is hidden and the interfaces are inaccessible. The protocol is proprietary and there is no mechanism to know what is running within your network.<br><br>
      In this talk, we will have a quick overview on Cisco's Autonomic Network Architecture, then I will reverse-engineer the proprietary protocol through its multiple phases. Finally, multiple vulnerabilities (overall 5) will be presented, one of which allows to crash systems remotely by knowing their IPv6 address.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">Omar Eissa is a security Analyst working for ERNW. His interests are network security and reverse-engineering. He is a professional Cisco engineer with various years of experience in enterprise and ISPs networks. He has given talks and workshops at various telco events and conferences like Troopers17 and Black Hat USA 2017.</p>

      <p class="speaker">5A1F (Saif El-Sherei), Security Analyst, SensePost</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 13:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Demo, Exploit</p>
      <p class="abstract">Windows kernel exploitation is a difficult field to get into. Learning the field well enough to write your own exploits require full walkthroughs and few of those exist. This talk will do that, release two exploits and a new GDI object abuse technique.<br><br>
      We will provide all the detailed steps taken to develop a full privilege escalation exploit. The process includes reversing a Microsoft's patch, identifying and analyzing two bugs, developing PoCs to trigger them, turning them into code execution and then putting it all together. The result is an exploit for Windows 8.1 x64 using GDI bitmap objects and a new, previously unreleased Windows 7 SP1 x86 exploit involving the abuse of a newly discovered GDI object abuse technique.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">Saif is a senior analyst with SensePost. He has a keen interest in exploit development and sharing everything he learns. Over the years he has released several exploitation tutorials, examples and a grammar-based browser fuzzer, wadi (DEF CON 23).<br>

      <p class="speaker">Lisa Wiswell, Principal, Grimm Fellow, Center for Strategic and International Studies</p>
      <p class="abstract">Making legal and policy progress on security is hard, especially when it involves coordinating with teams inside and across federal agencies/departments. But, there *are* success stories. DOJ, FDA, FTC, and DoD have all evolved in positive directions in their approach to security over the last five years, engaging more robustly with the security research community. The panelists will introduce their respective agencies/ departments, explain their missions, and describe the evolution of their organizations' approach across time to security and security research. As always, the panelists look forward to answering your questions.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Joe FitzPatrick, SecuringHardware.com</p>
      <p class="speaker">Michael Leibowitz, Senior Trouble Maker</p>
      <p class="abstract">Let's face it, software security is still in pretty bad shape. We could tell ourselves that everything is fine, but in our hearts, we know the world is on fire. Even as hackers, it's incredibly hard to know whether your computer, phone, or secure messaging app is pwned. Of course, there's a Solution(tm) - hardware security devices.<br><br>
      We carry authentication tokens not only to secure our banking and corporate VPN connections, but also to access everything from cloud services to social networking. While we've isolated these 'trusted' hardware components from our potentially pwnd systems so that they might be more reliable, we will present scenarios against two popular hardware tokens where their trust can be easily undermined. After building our modified and counterfeit devices, we can use them to circumvent intended security assumptions made by their designers and users. In addition to covering technical details about our modifications and counterfeit designs, we'll explore a few attack scenarios for each.<br><br>
      Sharing is Caring, so after showing off a few demonstration, we'll walk you through the process of rolling your own Secure Tokin' and Doobiekey that you can pass around the circle at your next cryptoparty.</p>

      <p class="datetime">Friday at 10:00 in Track 4 -- 20 minutes | 0025</p>
      <p class="abstract">Imagine that you're accused of a crime, and the basis of the accusation is a log entry generated by a piece of custom software. You might have some questions: does the software work?  how accurate is it?  how did it get the results that it did?  Unfortunately, the software isn't available to the public. And you can't get access to the source code or even a working instance of the software. All you get are assurances that the software is in use by investigators around the globe, and doesn't do anything that law enforcement isn't supposed to be doing. Because you can trust the government, right?<br><br>
      This talk will look at a family of tools designed for investigating peer-to- peer networks. By synthesizing information from dozens of search warrant affidavits, and a few technical sources, we're able to put together at least a partial picture of the software's capabilities. But we'll also look at the reasons the government offers for keeping these tools out of the public eye and talk about whether they make sense. Finally, we'll examine the implications that investigations based on secret capabilities have for justice.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">After 18 years in IT, with 16 of those years spent in security and penetration testing, Foofus now works as an attorney.

In this capacity he does forensic analysis and assists other attorneys with strategy for presenting (or calling into question) computer-based evidence. In his spare time, Foofus enjoys cooking, playing guitar, and opera. Oh, and remember CoffeeWars? Foofus was pretty involved with that</p>

      <p class="abstract">Attention Red Teamers, Penetration Testers, and Offensive Security Operators, isn't the overhead of fighting attribution, spinning up infrastructure, and having to constantly re-write malware an absolute pain and timesink!?! It was for us too, so we're fixing that for good (well, maybe for evil). Join us for the public unveiling and open source release of our latest project, MEATPISTOL, a modular malware framework for implant creation, infrastructure automation, and shell interaction. This framework is designed to meet the needs of offensive security operators requiring rapid configuration and creation of long lived malware implants and associated command and control infrastructure. Say goodbye to writing janky one-off malware and say hello to building upon a framework designed to support efficient yoloscoped adversarial campaigns against capable targets.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">FuzzyNop and ceyx were raised by computerized wolves with a penchant for fine art and rum based cocktails. While technically from different mothers and also sides of the world, they formed the first cyber wolf brothership shell-bent to ameliorate the state of targeted malware implants to support the ongoing war against the institutionalized mediocrity of the corporate shadow government. Working in tandem with dolphin researchers funded by the oligarch llamas they have found a way to synthesize powdered ethanol into mechanical pony fuel. Leading Offensive Security functions at Salesforce is merely a front to confuse the saurian overlords of their true purpose yet to be revealed...</p>

      <p class="speaker">Gil Cohen, CTO, Comsec group</p>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 14:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">The typical security professional is largely unfamiliar with the Windows named pipes interface, or considers it to be an internal-only communication interface.<br>As a result, open RPC (135) or SMB (445) ports are typically considered potentially entry points in "infrastructure" penetration tests.<br><br>
      However, named pipes can in fact be used as an application-level entry vector for well known attacks such as buffer overflow, denial of service or even code injection attacks and XML bombs, depending on the nature of listening service to the specific pipe on the target machine.<br><br>
      As it turns out, it seems that many popular and widely used Microsoft Windows-based enterprise applications open a large number of named pipes on each endpoint or server on which they are deployed, significantly increase an environment's attack surface without the organization or end user being aware of the risk.<br>Since there's a complete lack of awareness to the entry point, there's very limited options available to organizations to mitigate it, making it a perfect attack target for the sophisticated attacker.<br><br>
      In this presentation we will highlight how named pipes have become a neglected and forgotten external interface. We will show some tools that can help find vulnerable named pipes, discuss the mitigations, and demonstrate the exploitation process on a vulnerable interface.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">Gil is an experienced application security instructor, architect, consultant and pentester just starting his 12th year in the field.

      <p class="abstract">Existing fingerprinting mechanisms to identify client devices on a network tend to be coarse in their identification. For example they can tell it is an iPhone of some kind, or that it is a Samsung Android device of some model. They might look at DHCP information to know its OS, see if the client responds to SSDP, or check DNS-SD TXT responses.<br><br>
      By examining Wi-Fi Management frames we can identify the device much more specifically. We can tell a iPhone 5S from an iPhone 5, a Samsung Galaxy S8 from an S7, an LG G5 from a G4. This talk describes how the signature mechanism works.<br><br>
      Specifically identifying the client is the first step toward further scanning or analysis of that client's behavior on the network.</p>

      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 17:00 in Track 3 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="abstract">What if you could super-charge your web hacking? Not through pure automation (since it can miss so much) but through powerful alerts created from real threat intelligence? What if you had a Burp plugin that did this for you? What if that plugin not only told you where to look for vulns but also gave you curated resources for additional exploitation and methodology? What if you could organize your web hacking methodology inside of your tools? Well, now you do! HUNT is a new Burp Suite extension that aims to arm web hackers with parameter level suggestions on where to look for certain classes of vulnerabilities (SQLi, CMDi, LFI/RFI, and more!). This data is parsed from hundreds of real-world assessments, providing the user with the means to effectively root out critical issues. Not only will HUNT help you assess large targets more thoroughly but it also aims to organize common web hacking methodologies right inside of Burp suite. As an open source project, we will go over the data driven design of HUNT and it's core functionality. </p>

      <p class="abstract">Law enforcement agencies have used aircraft for decades to conduct surveillance, but modern radio, camera, and electronics technology has dramatically expanded the power and scope of police surveillance capabilities. The Iraq War and other conflicts have spurred the development of mass surveillance technologies and techniques that are now widely available to domestic police. The FBI, DEA, and other agencies flew powerful surveillance aircraft over cities for years in relative secrecy before breaking in to public attention in 2015. This presentation will discuss the capabilities of these aircraft, the discovery of the FBI and others' surveillance fleets, and continued efforts to shed light on aerial surveillance. We will discuss a method for detecting surveillance indicators in real time based on mutilateration of aggregated ADS-B data, and introduce code for detecting surveillance indicators from flight behavior.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Siegfried Rasthofer, Fraunhofer SIT</p>
      <p class="abstract">Security experts recommend using different, complex passwords for individual services, but everybody knows the issue arising from this approach: It is impossible to keep all the complex passwords in mind. One solution to this issue are password managers, which aim to provide a secure, centralized storage for credentials. The rise of mobile password managers even allows the user to carry their credentials in their pocket, providing instant access to these credentials if required. This advantage can immediately turn into a disadvantage as all credentials are stored in one central location. What happens if your device gets lost, stolen or a hacker gets access to your device? Are your personal secrets and credentials secure?<br><br>
      We say no! In our recent analysis of well-known Android password manager apps, amongst them are vendors such as LastPass, Dashlane, 1Password, Avast, and several others, we aimed to bypass their security by either stealing the master password or by directly accessing the stored credentials. Implementation flaws resulted in severe security vulnerabilities. In all of those cases, no root permissions were required for a successful attack. We will explain our attacks in detail. We will also propose possible security fixes and recommendations on how to avoid the vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Are you curious about the impact of fake news and influence operations on elections?  Are you concerned about the vulnerability of democratic institutions, the media, and civil society?  Then come engage with your peers and the first US National Intelligence Officer for Cyber Issues on ways to hack democracy. He will: (1) provide a low-tech, strategic analysis of recent events, foreign intelligence threats, and the future of information warfare; (2) lead a Socratic dialogue with attendees about the trade-offs between national security and core democratic values (such as freedom, equality, and privacy); and (3) open the floor to audience questions and/or a moderated group debate.<br><br>
      This session is intended to be informal and participatory. It will cover a range of issues from supply chain attacks on voting machines to psychological operations by using an interdisciplinary approach that encompasses constitutional law, world history, game theory, social engineering, and international affairs. The discussion will occur against the backdrop of cyber security and critical infrastructure protection, but it will not examine any specific hardware or software systems; rather, it will concern the conceptual formulation and conduct of modern strategic influence campaigns. No specific knowledge is required, but a skeptical mind and mischievous intellect are a must.  </p>

      <p class="abstract">In the wake of recent presidential elections in the US and France, "hacking" has taken on new political and social dimensions around the globe. We are now faced with a world of complex influence operations and dubious integrity of information. What does that imply for democratic institutions, legitimacy, and public confidence?<br><br>
      This session will explore how liberal democracy can be hacked — ranging from direct manipulation of electronic voting tallies or voter registration lists to indirect influence over mass media and voter preferences — and question the future role of "truth" in open societies. Both domestic partisan activities and foreign interventions will be considered on technical, legal, and philosophical grounds. The speaker will build on his experience as an intelligence professional to analyze foreign capabilities and intentions in the cyber sphere in order to forecast the future of information warfare. Audience members will be engaged in a Socratic dialogue to think through how modern technologies can be used to propagate memes and influence the electorate. The feasibility of, and public policy challenges associated with, various approaches to hacking democracy will also be considered. This conceptual discussion of strategic influence campaigns will not require any specific technical or legal knowledge</p>

      <p class="datetime">Friday at 11:00 in Track 3 -- 45 minutes | Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">It can be argued that the DAO hack of June 2016 was the moment smart contracts entered mainstream awareness in the InfoSec community. Was the hope of taking blockchain from mere cryptocurrency platform to one that can perform amazing Turing-complete functions doomed? We've learned quite a lot from that attack against contract code, and Ethereum marches on. Smart contracts are a key part of the applications being created by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Quorum, and smaller projects in financial and other companies. Ethical hacking of smart contracts is a critical new service that is needed. And as is the case with coders of Solidity (the language of Ethereum smart contracts), hackers able to find security flaws in the code are in high demand.<br><br>
      Join Konstantinos for an introduction to a methodology that can be applied to Solidity code review ... and potentially adapted to other smart contract projects. We'll examine the few tools that are needed, as well as the six most common types of flaws, illustrated using either public or sanitized real world" vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov has a unique place in history as the proverbial "man" in "man vs. machine" thanks to his iconic matches against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. Kasparov walked away from that watershed moment in artificial intelligence history with a passion for finding ways humans and intelligent machines could work together. In the spirit of "if you can't beat'em, join'em," Kasparov has explored that potential for the 20 years since his loss to Deep Blue. Navigating a practical and hopeful approach between the utopian and dystopian camps, Kasparov focuses on how we can rise to the challenge of the AI revolution despite job losses to automation and refuting those who say our technology is making us less human. He includes concrete examples and forward-looking strategies on AI.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">Garry Kasparov was born in Baku, Azerbaijan, in the Soviet Union in 1963. He became the youngest world chess champion in history in 1985 and was the world's top-rated player for 20 years, until he retired in 2005. His matches against arch-rival Anatoly Karpov and the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue popularized chess and machine intelligence in unprecedented ways. Kasparov became a pro-democracy leader in Russia and an outspoken defender of individual freedom around the world, a mission he continues as the chairman of the New York-based Human Rights Foundation. He is a Visiting Fellow at the Oxford-Martin School, where his lectures focus on human-machine collaboration. Kasparov is a provocative speaker who appears frequently before business, academic, and political audiences to speak about decision-making, strategy, technology, and artificial intelligence. His influential writings on politics, cognition, and tech have appeared in dozens of major publications around the world. He has written two acclaimed series of chess books and the bestsellers How Life Imitates Chess on decision-making and Winter Is Coming on Russia and Vladimir Putin. His new book, Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins comes out in May 2017. In 2016, he was named a Security Ambassador by Avast, where he discusses cybersecurity and the digital future. He lives in New York City with his wife Dasha and their two children.<br>

      <p class="abstract">Translators are invisible, when they are present it is assumed that they know the language and are accurately translating between the languages. But how do you assure that the translator is accurately translating or working without an agenda? Although many of the case studies presented in this talk will  focus on translating between different languages, the basic premise can be applied in any case where information needs to be shared among 2 or more different contexts. (i.e.: Sales vs Engineering, Government vs Private sector etc) . The talk will showcase publicly known historical cases and personal experiences where translation errors (accidental and deliberate) have lead to misunderstandings some with dire consequences. Also the talk will showcase using translators as an offensive tool (i.e.:How to create more credible fake news). We as a society consume more information and consume it faster than before, we have to be aware of the dangers that are inherit with bad translations. Also the infosec/cyber security profession because of the potential for large scale global impacts  and or the need to maintain operational security poses unique considerations when translating or using a translator. This talk will highlight the unique challenges of using a translator or translations in such environments.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Marc Newlin, Security Researcher at Bastille</p>
      <p class="abstract">What do the Dallas tornado siren attack, hacked electric skateboards, and insecure smart door locks have in common? Vulnerable wireless protocols. Exploitation of wireless devices is growing increasingly common, thanks to the proliferation of radio frequency protocols driven by mobile and IoT. While non-Wi-Fi and non-Bluetooth RF protocols remain a mystery to many security practitioners, exploiting them is easier than one might think.<br><br>
      Join us as we walk through the fundamentals of radio exploitation. After introducing essential RF concepts and characteristics, we will develop a wireless threat taxonomy by analyzing and classifying different methods of attack. As we introduce each new attack, we will draw parallels to similar wired network exploits, and highlight attack primitives that are unique to RF. To illustrate these concepts, we will show each attack in practice with a series of live demos built on software-defined and hardware radios.<br><br>
      Attendees will come away from this session with an understanding of the mechanics of wireless network exploitation, and an awareness of how they can bridge their IP network exploitation skills to the wireless domain.</p>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Persisting with Microsoft Office: Abusing Extensibility Options</h2>
      <p class="speaker">William Knowles, MWR InfoSecurity</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 10:00 in 101 Track -- 20 minutes | Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">One software product that red teamers will almost certainly find on any compromised workstation is Microsoft Office. This talk will discuss the ways that native functionality within Office can be abused to obtain persistence. The following opportunities for Office-based persistence will be discussed:<br><br>
          (1) WLL and XLL add-ins for Word and Excel - a legacy add-in that allows arbitrary DLL loading.<br>    (2) VBA add-ins for Excel and PowerPoint - an alternative to backdoored template files, which executes whenever the applications load.<br>    (3) COM add-ins for all Office products - an older cross-application add-in that leverages COM objects.<br>    (4) Automation add-ins for Excel - user defined functions that allow command execution through spreadsheet formulae.<br>    (5) VBA editor (VBE) add-ins for all VBA using Office products - executing commands when someone tries to catch you using VBA to execute commands.<br>    (6) VSTO add-ins for all Office products - the newer cross-application add-in that leverages a special Visual Studio runtime.<br><br>
      Each persistence mechanism will be discussed in terms of its relative advantages and disadvantages for red teamers. In particular, with regards to their complexity to deploy, privilege requirements, and applicability to Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments which hinder the use of many traditional persistence mechanisms.<br><br>
      The talk isn't all red - there's also some blue to satisfy the threat hunters and incident responders amongst us. The talk will finish with approaches to detection and prevention of these persistence mechanisms.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Artem Kondratenko, Penetration Tester, Security Researcher</p>
      <p class="datetime">Friday at 17:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">On March 17th, Cisco Systems Inc. made a public announcement that over 300 of the switches it manufactures are prone to a critical vulnerability that allows a potential attacker to take full control of the network equipment.<br><br>
      This damaging public announcement was preceded by Wikileaks' publication of documents codenamed as "Vault 7" which contained information on vulnerabilities and description of tools needed to access phones, network equipment and even IOT devices.<br><br>
      Cisco Systems Inc. had a huge task in front of them - patching this vast amount of different switch models is not an easy task. The remediation for this vulnerability was available with the initial advisory and patched versions of IOS software were announced on May 8th 2017.<br><br>
      We all heard about modern exploit mitigation techniques such as Data Execution Prevention, Layout Randomization. But just how hardened is the network equipment? And how hard is it to find critical vulnerabilities? <br><br>
      To answer that question I decided to reproduce the steps necessary to create a fully working tool to get remote code execution on Cisco switches mentioned in the public announcement.<br><br>
      This presentation is a detailed write-up of the exploit development process for the vulnerability in Cisco Cluster Management Protocol that allows a full takeover of the device.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Everyone loves cloud-AV. Why not harness the wisdom of clouds to protect the enterprise? Consider a high-security enterprise with strict egress filtering - endpoints have no direct Internet connection, or the endpoints' connection to the Internet is restricted to hosts used by their legitimately installed software. Let's say there's malware running on an endpoint with full privileges. The malware still can't exfiltrate data due to the strict egress filtering.<br><br>
      Now let'also assume that this enterprise uses cloud-enhanced anti-virus (AV).You'd argue that if malware is already running on the endpoint with full privileges, then an AV agent can't degrade the security of the endpoint. And you'd be completely wrong.<br><br>
      In this presentation, we describe and demonstrate a novel technique for exfiltrating data from highly secure enterprises which employ strict egress filtering. Assuming the endpoint has a cloud-enhanced antivirus installed, we show that if the AV employs an Internet-connected sandbox in its cloud, it in fact facilitates such exfiltration. We release a tool implementing the exfiltration technique, and provide real-world results from several prominent AV products. We also provide insights on AV in-the-cloud sandboxes. Finally we address the issues of how to further enhance the attack, and possible mitigations.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Zhang Yunhai, Security researcher of NSFOCUS Security Team</p>
      <p class="abstract">In the past few years, attacks against industrial control systems (ICS) have increased year over year. Stuxnet in 2010 exploited the insecurity of the S7Comm protocol, the communication protocol used between Siemens Simatic S7 PLCs to cause serious damage in nuclear power facilities. After the exposure of Stuxnet, Siemens has implemented some security reinforcements into the S7Comm protocol. The current S7CommPlus protocol implementing encryption has been used in S7-1200 V4.0 and above, as well as S7-1500, to prevent attackers from controlling and damaging the PLC devices.<br><br>
      Is the current S7CommPlus a real high security protocol? This talk will demonstrate a spear that can break the security wall of the S7CommPlus protocol. First, we use software like Wireshark to analyze the communications between the Siemens TIA Portal and PLC devices. Then, using reverse debugging software like WinDbg and IDA we can break the encryption in the S7CommPlus protocol. Finally, we write a MFC program which can control the start and the stop of the PLC, as well as value changes of PLC's digital and analog inputs &amp; outputs.<br><br>Based on the research above, we present two security proposals at both code level and protocol level to improve the security of Siemens PLC devices.</p>

      <p class="abstract">The talk has two sections - useful and embarrassing.<br><br>
      In the 'useful' section of this fun filled talk we show how we combine the power of Maltego and Shodan to hunt for ICS devices on the Internet. We tackle the difficult problem of finding the function, owners and locations of these devices using OSINT and Maltego. The result is a one click sequence of transforms that makes finding interesting ICS devices child's play. In the 'embarrassing' section we look at how network footprinting (which we've refined to an art in Maltego) becomes useful for identifying and profiling people who's job description involves lots of lies and who probably does not want to be associated with the data that's out there on them.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Dhia Mahjoub, Head of Security Research, Cisco Umbrella (OpenDNS)</p>
      <p class="abstract">Prior research detailing the relationship between malware, bulletproof hosting, and SSL gave researchers methods to investigate SSL data only if given a set of seed domains. We present a novel statistical technique that allow us to discover botnet and bulletproof hosting IP space by examining SSL distribution patterns from open source data while working with limited or no seed information. This work can be accomplished using open source datasets and data tools.<br><br>
      SSL data obtained from scanning the entire IPv4 namespace can be represented as a series of 4 million node bipartite graphs where a common name is connected to either an IP/CIDR/ASN via an edge. We use the concept of relative entropy to create a pairwise distance metric between any two common names and any two ASNs. The metric allows us to generalize the concept of regular and anomalous SSL distribution patterns.  <br><br>
      Relative entropy is useful in identifying domains that have anomalous network structures. The domains we found in this case were related to the Zbot proxy network. The Zbot proxy network contains a structure similar to popular CDNs like Akamai, Google, etc but instead rely on compromised devices to relay their data. Through layering these SSL signals with passive DNS data we create a pipeline that can extract Zbot domains with high accuracy.</p>

      <p class="abstract">The current consensus within the security industry is that high-assurance systems cannot tolerate the presence of compromised hardware components. In this talk, we challenge this perception and demonstrate how trusted, high-assurance hardware can be built from untrusted and potentially malicious components.<br><br>
      The majority of IC vendors outsource the fabrication of their designs to facilities overseas, and rely on post-fabrication tests to weed out deficient chips. However, such tests are not effective against: 1) subtle unintentional errors (e.g., malfunctioning RNGs) and 2) malicious circuitry (e.g., stealthy Hardware Trojans). Such errors are very hard to detect and require constant upgrades of expensive forensics equipment, which contradicts the motives of fabrication outsourcing.<br><br>
      In this session, we introduce a high-level architecture that can tolerate multiple, malicious hardware components, and outline a new approach in hardware compromises risk management. We first demo our backdoor-tolerant Hardware Security Module built from low-cost commercial off-the-shelf components, benchmark its performance, and delve into its internals. We then explain the importance of "component diversification" and "non-overlapping supply chains", and finally discuss how "mutual distrust" can be exploited to further reduce the capabilities of the adversaries.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Jon Medina, Protiviti</p>
      <p class="datetime">Thursday at 10:00 in 101 Track2 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="abstract">Software Defined Networking is no longer a fledgling technology. Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Verizon all rely on the scalability, programmability, flexibility, availability, and yes, security provided by SDN. So why has there only ever been one DEF CON speaker presenting on SDN and security?<br><br>
      This talk will provide a brief introduction to SDN and security, demonstrate ways of compromising and securing a Software Defined Network and will illustrate new ways of using the power of open source SDN coupled with machine learning to maintain self-defending networks. </p>

      <p class="speaker">Salvador Mendoza, Hacker</p>
      <p class="datetime">Thursday at 15:20 in 101 Track 2 -- 20 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit</p>
      <p class="abstract">A massive attack against old magnetic stripe information could be executed with precision implementing new technology. In the past, a malicious individual could spoof magstripe data but in a slow and difficult way. Also brute force attacks were tedious and time-consuming. Technology like Bluetooth could be used today to make a persistent attack in multiple magnetic card readers at the same time with audio spoof.<br><br>
      Private companies, banks, trains, subways, hotels, schools and many others services are still using magstripe information to even make monetary transactions, authorize access or to generate "new" protocols like MST(Magnetic Secure Transmission) During decades the exploitation of magstripe information was an acceptable risk for many companies because the difficulty to achieve massive attacks simultaneously was not factible. But today is different.<br><br>
      Transmitting magstripe information in audio files is the faster and easier way to make a cross-platform magstripe spoofer. But how an attacker could transmit the audio spoof information to many magnetic card readers at the same time? In this talk, we will discuss how an attacker could send specific data or achieve a magstripe jammer for credit card terminals, PoS or any card reader. Also, how it could be implemented to generate brute force attacks against hotel door locks or tokenization processes as examples.</p>

      <p class="abstract">The Federal Trade Commission is a law enforcement agency tasked with protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive practices. Protecting consumers on the Internet and from bad tech is nothing new for the FTC. We will take a look back at what the FTC was doing when DEF CON  first began in 1993, and what we've been doing since. We will discuss enforcement actions involving modem hijacking, FUD advertising, identity theft, and even introduce you to Dewie the e-Turtle. Looking forward, we will talk about the FTC's future protecting consumers' privacy and data security and what you can do to help.</p>

      <p class="speakerBio">Terrell McSweeny serves as a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. This year marks her fourth time at DEF CON . When it comes to tech issues, Commissioner McSweeny has focused on the valuable role researchers and hackers can play protecting consumer data security and privacy. She opposes bad policy and legislative proposals like mandatory backdoors and the criminalization of hacking and believes that enforcers like the FTC should work with the researcher community to protect consumers. She wants companies to implement security by design, privacy by design and data ethics design - but recognizes that, in the absence of regulation, enforcement and research are the only means of holding companies accountable for the choices they make in the ways that they hold and use consumer data.<br>

      <p class="abstract">2016 was the year of Java deserialization apocalypse. Although Java Deserialization attacks were known for years, the publication of the Apache Commons Collection Remote Code Execution (RCE from now on) gadget finally brought this forgotten vulnerability to the spotlight and motivated the community to start finding and fixing these issues.<br><br>
      One of the most suggested solutions for avoiding Java deserialization issues was to move away from Java Deserialization altogether and use safer formats such as JSON. In this talk, we will analyze the most popular JSON parsers in both .NET and Java for potential RCE vectors.<br><br>
      We will demonstrate that RCE is also possible in these libraries and present details about the ones that are vulnerable to RCE by default. We will also discuss common configurations that make other libraries vulnerable.<br><br>
      In addition to focusing on JSON format, we will generalize the attack techniques to other serialization formats. In particular, we will pay close attention to several serialization formats in .NET. These formats have also been known to be vulnerable since 2012 but the lack of known RCE gadgets led some software vendors to not take this issue seriously. We hope this talk will change this. With the intention of bringing the due attention to this vulnerability class in .NET, we will review the known vulnerable formats, present other formats which we found to be vulnerable as well and conclude presenting several gadgets from system libraries that may be used to achieve RCE in a stable way: no memory corruption — just simple process invocation.<br><br>
      Finally, we will provide recommendations on how to determine if your code is vulnerable, provide remediation advice, and discuss alternative approaches.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Chris Grayson, Founder and Principal Engineer at Web Sight.IO</p>
      <p class="abstract">We discovered a wide array of critical vulnerabilities in ISP-provided, RDK-based wireless gateways and set-top boxes from vendors including Cisco, Arris, Technicolor, and Motorola. Our research shows that it was possible to remotely and wirelessly tap all Internet and voice traffic passing through the affected gateways, impacting millions of ISP customers.<br><br>
      Imagine for a moment that you want a root shell on an ISP-provided wireless gateway, but you're tired of the same old web vulns. You want choice. Maybe you want to generate the passphrase for the hidden Wi-Fi network, or log into the web UI remotely using hard-coded credentials.<br><br>
      Don't have an Internet connection? Not to worry! You can just impersonate a legitimate ISP customer and hop on the nearest public hotspot running on another customer's wireless gateway. Once online, you can head on over to GitHub and look at the vulnerability fixes that haven't yet been pushed to customer equipment.<br><br>
      In this talk, we will take you through the research process that lead to these discoveries, including technical specifics of each exploit. After showcasing some of the more entertaining attack chains, we will discuss the remediation actions taken by the affected vendors.</p>

      <p class="abstract">You've planned this engagement for weeks. Everything's mapped out. You have tested all your proxy and VPN connections. You are confident your anonymity will be protected. You fire off the first round and begin attacking your target. Suddenly something goes south. Your access to the target site is completely blocked no matter what proxy or VPN you use. Soon, your ISP contacts you reminding you of their TOS while referencing complaints from the target of your engagement. You quickly switch MAC addresses and retry only to find that you are quickly blocked again!<br><br>
      What happened? How were you betrayed? The culprit? Your dastardly DNS resolvers and more specifically, the use of certain EDNS0 options by those resolvers.<br><br>
      This presentation will cover the ways in which EDNS OPT code data can divulge details about your online activity, look at methods for discovering implementation by upstream DNS providers and discuss ways in which malicious actors can abuse these features. We will also examine steps you can take to protect yourself from these invasive disclosures.<br><br>
      The details covered will be only moderately technical. Having a basic understanding of RFC 6891 and general DNS processes will help in understanding. We will discuss the use of basic tools including Wireshark, Packetbeat, Graylog and Dig. </p>

      <p class="abstract">Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and, more generally, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) wireless communications enable semi-autonomous driving via the exchange of state information between a network of connected vehicles and infrastructure units. Following 10+ years of standards development, particularly of IEEE 802.11p and the IEEE 1609 family, a lack of available implementations has prevented the involvement of the security community in development and testing of these standards. Analysis of the WAVE/DSRC protocols in their existing form reveals the presence of vulnerabilities which have the potential to render the protocol unfit for use in safety-critical systems. We present a complete Linux-stack based implementation of IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609.3/4 which provide a means for hackers and academics to participate in the engineering of secure standards for intelligent transportation systems.</p>

      p3n3troot0r began working V2X with ginsback two years ago and realized the opportunity, in lieu of any open-source or full-stack V2X implementation, to bring the security community in to the driver's seat in the development of next-gen cyberauto standards. Together they have engaged the thought leaders in this space, and via the long-awaited integration of this stack into the mainline Linux kernel, the global development community is given the opportunity to participate in the development of automated and connected transportation systems.</p>

      Given the (abyssal) state of automotive cybersecurity, ginsback aims to develop and field tools for V2X that open collaboration with the hacker community. As intelligent transit reaches critical mass, attacks on V2X infrastructure have the potential to cause incredible damage. ginsback partnered with p3n3troot0r to develop a free as in freedom V2X interface and extend an invitation for the community to discover and fix flaws in the design of what will soon be a massive network of connected vehicles.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Every year thousands of organizations are compromised by targeted attacks. In many cases the attacks are labeled as advanced and persistent which suggests a high level of sophistication in the attack and tools used. Many times, this title is leveraged as an excuse that the events were inevitable or irresistible, as if the assailants' skill set is well beyond what defenders are capable of. To the contrary, often these assailants are not as untouchable as many would believe.<br><br>
      If one looks at the many APT reports that have been released over the years some clear patterns start to emerge. A small number of Remote Administration Tools are preferred by actors and reused across multiple campaigns. Frequently sited tools include Gh0st RAT, Plug-X, and XtremeRAT among others. Upon examination, the command and control components of these notorious RATs are riddled with vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities that can be exploited to turn the tables from hunter to hunted.<br><br>
      The presentation will disclose several exploits that could allow remote execution or remote information disclosure on computers running these well-known C&amp;C components. It should serve as a warning to those actors who utilize such toolsets. That is to say, such actors live in glass houses and should stop throwing stones.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Women's health is big business. There are a staggering number of applications for Android to help people keep track of their monthly cycle, know when they may be fertile, or track the status of their pregnancy. These apps entice the user to input the most intimate details of their lives, such as their mood, sexual activity, physical activity, physical symptoms, height, weight, and more. But how private are these apps, and how secure are they really? After all, if an app has such intimate details about our private lives it would make sense to ensure that it is not sharing those details with anyone such as another company or an abusive partner/parent. To this end EFF and Journalist Kashmir Hill have taken a look at some of the privacy and security properties of over a dozen different fertility and pregnancy tracking apps. Through our research we have uncovered several privacy issues in many of the applications as well as some notable security flaws as well as a couple of interesting security features.</p>

      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 16:00 in Track 2 -- 45 minutes | Hacker History</p>
      <p class="speaker"> Eden Shochat, Equal Partner, Aleph</p>
      <p class="abstract">The late 80's and early 90's played a pivotal role in the forming of the Israeli tech scene as we know it today, producing companies like Checkpoint, Waze, Wix, Mobileye, Viber and billions of dollars in fundraising and exits. The people who would later build that industry were in anywhere from elementary school to high school, and their paths included some of the best hacking stories of the time (certainly in the eyes of the locals). The combination of extremely expensive Internet and international dial system, non-existent legal enforcement and a lagging national phone company could not prevent dozens of hungry-for-knowledge kids from teaching themselves the dark arts of reversing, hacking, cracking, phreaking and even carding. The world looked completely different back then and we have some great stories for you. We will cover the evolution of the many-years-later-to-be-named-Cyber community, including personal stories from nearly all categories. Come listen how the Israeli Cyber "empire" was born, 25 years ago, from the perspectives of 2:401/100 and 2:401/100.1.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">Inbar has been reverse engineering for nearly as long as he has been living. It started with a screwdriver, pliers, wire cutters, and his grandfather's ECG machine, and gradually transitioned into less destructive research. In 1984, aged 9, he started programming on his Dragon 64. At 13 he got his first PC - Amstrad PC1512 - and within a year was already into reverse engineering. It wasn't long before he discovered how to access the X.25 network, Bitnet and Fidonet, and through high-school he was a key figure in the Israeli BBS scene.<br>

      <p class="speaker">Redezem, Hacker</p>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 10:20 in Track 2 -- 20 minutes | Art of Defense, Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="abstract">Denial of service. It requires a low level of resources and knowledge, it is very easy to deploy, it is very common and it is remarkable how effective it is overall. PEIMA is a brand new method of client side malicious activity detection based on mathematical laws, usually used in finance, text retrieval and social media analysis, that is fast, accurate, and capable of determining when denial of service attacks start and stop without flagging legitimate heavy interest in your server erroneously. However, denial of service attacks aren't the only type of anomalous activity you can look at with PEIMA. Learn what kinds of unusual identifying metrics you can get out of your network and users to help detect intrusions and, ultimately, defend your assets.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Will Schroeder, Offensive Engineer</p>
      <p class="abstract">Active Directory (AD) object discretionary access control lists (DACLs) are an untapped offensive landscape, often overlooked by attackers and defenders alike. The control relationships between AD objects align perfectly with the "attackers think in graphs" philosophy and expose an entire class of previously unseen control edges, dramatically expanding the number of paths to complete domain compromise.<br><br>
      While DACL misconfigurations can provide numerous paths that facilitate elevation of domain rights, they also present a unique chance to covertly deploy Active Directory persistence. It's often difficult to determine whether a specific AD DACL misconfiguration was set intentionally or implemented by accident. This makes Active Directory DACL backdoors an excellent persistence opportunity: minimal forensic footprint, and maximum plausible deniability.<br><br>
      This talk will cover Active Directory DACLs in depth, our "misconfiguration taxonomy", and enumeration/analysis with BloodHound's newly released feature set. We will cover the abuse of AD DACL misconfigurations for the purpose of domain rights elevation, including common misconfigurations encountered in the wild. We will then cover methods to design AD DACL backdoors, including ways to evade current detections, and will conclude with defensive mitigation/detection techniques for everything described.</p>

      GPS Spoofing is now a valid attack vector and can be done with minimal effort and cost. This raises some concerns when GPS is depended upon by safety of life applications. This presentation will look at the process for GPS and NMEA (the serial format that GPS receivers output) spoofing, how to detect the spoofing attacks and ways to manipulate the time on GPS synced NTP servers.

      <p class="speaker">Joe Rozner, Senior Software Security Engineer, Prevoty</p>
      <p class="datetime">Thursday at 13:00 in 101 Track 2 -- 45 minutes | Art of Defense, Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">CSRF remains an elusive problem due to legacy code, legacy frameworks, and developers not understanding the problem or how to protect against it. Wiping out CSRF introduces primitives and strategies for building solutions to CSRF that can be bolted on to any http application where http requests and responses can be intercepted, inspected, and modified. Modern frameworks have done a great job at providing solutions to the CSRF problem that automatically integrate into the application and solve most of the conditions. However, many existing apps and new apps that don't take advantage of these frameworks or use them incorrectly are still plagued with this problem. Wiping out CSRF will provide an in depth overview of the various reasons that CSRF occurs and provide payload examples to target those specific issues and variations. We'll see live demos of these attacks and the protections against them. Next we'll look at how to compose these primitives into a complete solution capable of solving most cases of CSRF explaining the limits and how to layer them to address potential short comings. Finally we'll finish by looking at Same Site Cookies, a new extension to cookies that could be the final nail in the coffin, and see how to use the prior solution as a graceful degradation for user agents that don't support it yet.</p>

      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 12:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="abstract">Most forms of WPA2-EAP have been broken for nearly a decade. EAP-TTLS and EAP-PEAP have long been susceptible to evil twin attacks, yet most enterprise organizations still rely on these technologies to secure their wireless infrastructure. The reason for this is that the secure alternative, EAP-TLS, is notoriously arduous to implement. To compensate for the weak perimeter security provided by EAP-TTLS and EAP-PEAP, many organizations use port based NAC appliances to prevent attackers from pivoting further into the network after the wireless has been breached. This solution is thought to provide an acceptable balance between security and accessibility. The problem with this approach is that it assumes that EAP is exclusively a perimeter defense mechanism. In this presentation, we will present a novel type of rogue access point attack that can be used to bypass port-based access control mechanisms in wireless networks. In doing so, we will challenge the assumption that reactive approaches to wireless security are an acceptable alternative to strong physical layer protections such as WPA2-EAP using EAP-TLS.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Morten Schenk, Security Advisor, Improsec</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 17:00 in Track 2 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Exploit</p>
      <p class="abstract">Since the release of Windows 10 and especially in the Anniversary and Creators Updates, Microsoft has continued to introduce exploit mitigations to the Windows kernel. These include full scale KASLR and blocking kernel pointer leaks.<br><br>
      This presentation picks up the mantle and reviews the powerful read and write kernel primitives that can still be leveraged despite the most recent hardening mitigations. The presented techniques include abusing the kernel-mode Window and Bitmap objects, which Microsoft has attempted to lock down several times. Doing so will present a generic approach to leveraging write-what-where vulnerabilities.<br><br>
      A stable and precise kernel exploit must be able to overcome KASLR, most often using kernel driver leaks. I will disclose several previously unknown KASLR bypasses in Windows 10 Creators Update. Obtaining kernel-mode code execution on Windows has become more difficult with the randomization of Page Table entries. I will show how a generic de-randomization of the Page Table entries can be performed through dynamic reverse engineering. Additionally, I will present an entirely different method which makes the usage of Page Table entries obsolete. This method allocates an arbitrary size piece of executable kernel pool memory and transfers code execution to it through hijacked system calls</p>

      <p class="abstract">What is cognitive memory? How can you "implant" a password into it? Is this truly secure? Curiosity around these questions prompted exploration of the research and concepts surrounding the idea of making the authentication process more secure by implanting passwords into an individual's memory. The result? The idea is that you are not able to reveal your credentials under duress but you are still able to authenticate to a system. We will begin with an understanding of cognitive memory. Implicit versus explicit memory will be defined. The concepts of the subconscious, unconscious, and consciousness will be addressed. The stages of memory pertaining to encoding, storage and retrieval as well as the limitations of human memory along with serial interception sequence learning training will round out our build up to the current research and experimentation being done with the proposal to implant passwords into an individual's cognitive memory. </p>

      <p class="abstract">We've built a $200 open source robot that cracks combination safes using a mixture of measuring techniques and set testing to reduce crack times to under an hour. By using a motor with a high count encoder we can take measurements of the internal bits of a combination safe while it remains closed. These measurements expose one of the digits of the combination needed to open a standard fire safe. Additionally, 'set testing' is a new method we created to decrease the time between combination attempts. With some 3D printing, Arduino, and some strong magnets we can crack almost any fire safe.

The master part can help people easily and successfully read almost all ISO 14443A type cards, (no matter what kind of this card is, bank card, ID card, Passport, access card, or whatever. No matter what security protocol this card uses, as long as it meets the ISO 14443A standard) meanwhile replaying this card to corresponding legal card reader via slave part to achieve our "evil" goals.

So how can we find vulnerabilities in a car with no budget?  We'll take you with us on a journey from zero car security validation experience through the discovery and disclosure of multiple remotely-exploitable automotive vulnerabilities. Along the way, we'll visit a wrecking yard, reassemble (most) of a 2015 Nissan Leaf in our lab, discuss how we picked our battles, fought them, and won. During our talk, we'll examine the details of three different classes of vulnerabilities we found in this vehicle, how they can be exploited, and the potential ramifications to the owner of their real-world exploitation. We'll also discuss the broader scope of the vulnerabilities discovered, how they extend beyond just this specific vehicle, and what the industry can do better to prevent these types of problems in the future.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Credentials have always served as a favorite target for advanced attackers, since these allow to efficiently traverse a network, without using any exploits.<br><br>
      Moreover, compromising the network might not be sufficient, as attackers strive to obtain persistency, which requires the use of advanced techniques to evade the security mechanisms installed along the way.<br><br>
      One of the challenges adversaries must face is: How to create threats that will continuously evade security mechanisms, and even if detected, ensure that control of the environment can be easily regained? <br><br>
      In this talk, we briefly discuss some of the past techniques for gaining persistency in a network (using local accounts, GPOs, skeleton key, etc.) and why they are insufficient nowadays.<br><br>
      Followed by a comprehensive analysis of lesser known mechanisms to achieve persistency, using non-mainstream methods (such as object manipulation, Kerberos delegation, etc.).<br><br>

Trusted security researchers have warned about the dangers of traveling through AirBnB's. Heeding their advice, I purchased a HooToo TM06 travel router to create my own little enclave while I bounce the globe. Being a researcher myself, I did some double checking.<br><br>
      So, I started fuzzing and reverse engineering. While the TM06 is a cute and versatile little device - protection against network threats, it is not. In this talk, I will take you on my journey revealing my methodology for discovering and exploiting two memory corruption vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are severe and while they've been reported to the vendor, they are very revealing data points about the security state of such devices. While the device employs some exploitation mitigations, there are many missing. I will be showing how I was able to bypass them and what mitigations should've been employed, such as NX-Stack/Heap, canaries, etc, to prevent me from gaining arbitrary shellcode execution.<br><br>

      <p class="speaker">John Sotos, Chief Medical Officer, Intel Corporation</p>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 12:00 in Track 4 -- 45 minutes</p>
      <p class="abstract">The human genome is, fundamentally, a complex open-source digital operating system (and set of application programs) built on the digital molecules DNA and RNA.<br><br>
      The genome has thousands of publicly documented, unpatchable security vulnerabilities, previously called "genetic diseases." Because emerging DNA/RNA technologies, including CRISPR-Cas9 and especially those arising from the Cancer Moonshot program, will create straightforward methods to digitally reprogram the genome in free-living humans, malicious exploitation of genomic vulnerabilities will soon be possible on a wide scale.<br><br>
      This presentation shows the breathtaking potential for such hacks, most notably the exquisite targeting precision that the genome supports — in effect, population, and time — spanning annoyance to organized crime to civilization-ending pandemics far worse than Ebola.<br><br>
      Because humans are poor at responding to less-than-immediate threats, and because there is no marketplace demand for defensive technologies on the DNA/RNA platform, the hacker community has an important role to play in devising thought-experiments to convince policy makers to initiate defensive works, before offensive hacks can be deployed in the wild.

      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 11:00 in Track 3 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit</p>
      <p class="abstract">Continuous Integration (CI) systems and similar architecture has taken new direction, especially in the last few years. Automating code builds, tests, and deployments is helping hordes of developers release code, and is saving companies a great amount of time and resources. But at what cost? The sudden and strong demand for these systems have created some widely adopted practices that have large security implications, especially if these systems are hosted internally. I have developed a tool that will help automate some offensive testing against certain popular CI build systems. There has been a large adoption of initiating these builds through web hooks of various kinds, especially changes to public facing code repositories. I will start with a brief overview of some of the more popular CI tools and how they are being used in many organizations. This is good information for understanding, at a high level, the purpose of these systems as well as some security benefits that they can provide. From there we will dive into specific examples of how these different CI implementations have created vulnerabilities (in one case to a CI vendor themselves). Last we will explore the tool, its purpose, and a demonstration of its use. This tool takes advantage of the configurations of various components of the build chain to look for vulnerabilities. It then has the capability to exploit, persist access, command and control vulnerable build containers. Most of the demonstration will revolve around specific CI products and repositories, however the concepts are applicable across most build systems. The goal here is to encourage further exploration of these exploitation concepts. The tool is built "modularly" to facilitate this. If you are new to CI and automated build systems, or if you have been doing it for years, this talk and tool will help you to better secure your architecture</p>

      <p class="speaker">Jason Staggs, Security Researcher at the University of Tulsa</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 10:20 in 101 Track -- 20 minutes</p>
      <p class="abstract">Wind farms are becoming a leading source for renewable energy. The increased reliance on wind energy makes wind farm control systems attractive targets for attackers. This talk explains how wind farm control networks work and how they can be attacked in order to negatively influence wind farm operations (e.g., wind turbine hijacking). Specifically, implementations of the IEC 61400-25 family of communications protocols are investigated (i.e., OPC XML-DA). This research is based on an empirical study of a variety of U.S. based wind farms conducted over a two year period. We explain how these security assessments reveal that wind farm vendor design and implementation flaws have left wind turbine programmable automation controllers and OPC servers vulnerable to attack. Additionally, proof-of-concept attack tools are developed in order to exploit wind farm control network design and implementation vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Psychographic targeting and the so called "Weaponized AI Propaganda Machine" have been blamed for swaying public opinion in recent political campaigns. But how effective are they? Why are people so divided on certain topics? And what influences their views? This talk presents the results of five studies exploring each of these questions. The studies examined authoritarianism, threat perception, personality-targeted advertising and biases in relation to support for communication surveillance as a counter-terrorism strategy. We found that people with an authoritarian disposition were more likely to be supportive of surveillance, but that those who are less authoritarian became increasingly supportive of such surveillance the greater they perceived the threat of terrorism. Using psychographic targeting we reached Facebook audiences with significantly different views on surveillance and demonstrated how tailoring pro and anti-surveillance ads based on authoritarianism affected return on marketing investment. Finally, we show how debunking propaganda faces big challenges as biases severely limit a person's ability to interpret evidence which runs contrary to their beliefs. The results illustrate the effectiveness of psychographic targeting and the ease with which individuals' inherent differences and biases can be exploited.</p>

      <p class="datetime">Thursday at 12:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="speaker">Matt Suiche, Founder, Comae Technologies</p>
      <p class="abstract">Ethereum is gaining a significant popularity in the blockchain community, mainly due to fact that it is design in a way that enables developers to write decentralized applications (Dapps) and smart-contract using blockchain technology.<br><br>
      Ethereum blockchain is a consensus-based globally executed virtual machine, also referred as  Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by implemented its own micro-kernel supporting a handful number of instructions, its own stack, memory and storage. This enables the radical new concept of distributed applications.<br><br>
      Contracts live on the blockchain in an Ethereum-specific binary format (EVM bytecode). However, contracts are typically written in some high-level language such as Solidity and then compiled into byte code to be uploaded on the blockchain. Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript.<br>This new paradigm of applications opens the door to many possibilities and opportunities. Blockchain is often referred as secure by design, but now that blockchains can embed applications this raise multiple questions regarding architecture, design, attack vectors and patch deployments.<br><br>
      As we, reverse engineers, know having access to source code is often a luxury. Hence, the need for an open-source tool like Porosity: decompiler for EVM bytecode into readable Solidity-syntax contracts - to enable static and dynamic analysis of compiled contracts.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Tomer Cohen, R&amp;D Security Team Leader, Wix.com</p>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 13:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">On April 16 2016, an army of bots stormed upon Wix servers, creating new accounts and publishing shady websites in mass. The attack was carried by a malicious Chrome extension, installed on tens of thousands of devices, sending HTTP requests simultaneously. This "Extension Bot" has used Wix websites platform and Facebook messaging service, to distribute itself among users. Two months later, same attackers strike again. This time they used infectious notifications, popping up on Facebook and leading to a malicious Windows-runnable JSE file. Upon clicking, the file ran and installed a Chrome extension on the victim's browser. Then the extension used Facebook messaging once again to pass itself on to more victims.<br><br>
      Analyzing these attacks, we were amazed by the highly elusive nature of these bots, especially when it comes to bypassing web-based bot-detection systems. This shouldn't be surprising, since legit browser extensions are supposed to send Facebook messages, create Wix websites, or in fact perform any action on behalf of the user.<br><br>
      On the other hand, smuggling a malicious extension into Google Web Store and distributing it among victims efficiently, like these attackers did, is let's say - not a stroll in the park. But don't worry, there are other options.<br><br>
      Recently, several popular Chrome extensions were found to be vulnerable to XSS. Yep, the same old XSS every rookie finds in so many web applications. So browser extensions suffer from it too, and sadly, in their case it can be much deadlier than in regular websites. One noticeable example is the Adobe Acrobat Chrome extension, which was silently installed on January 10 by Adobe, on an insane number of 30 million devices. A DOM-based XSS vulnerability in the extension (found by Google Project Zero) allowed an attacker to craft a content that would run Javascript as the extension.<br><br>
      In this talk I will show how such a flaw leads to full and permanent control over the victim's browser, turning the extension into zombie. Additionally, Shedding more light on the 2016 attacks on Wix and Facebook described in the beginning, I will demonstrate how an attacker can use similar techniques to distribute her malicious payload efficiently on to new victims, through popular social platforms - creating the web's most powerful botnet ever.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Richard Thieme a.k.a. neuralcowboy</p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 12:00 in Track 2 -- 45 minutes | 0025</p>
      <p class="abstract">"Get over it!" as Scott McNeeley said - unhelpfully. Only if we understand why it is gone and not coming back do we have a shot at rethinking what privacy means in a new context. Thieme goes deep and wide as he rethinks the place of privacy in the new social/cultural context and challenges contemporary discussions to stop using 20th century frames. Pictures don't fit those frames, including pictures of "ourselves." <br><br>
      We have always known we were cells in a body, but we emphasized "cell-ness". Now we have to emphasize "body-ness" and see ourselves differently. What we see depends on the level of abstraction at which we look. The boundaries we imagine around identities, psyches, private internal spaces," are violated in both directions, going in and going out, by data that, when aggregated, constitutes "us". We are known by others more deeply in recombination from metadata than we know ourselves. We are not who we think we are.<br><br>
      To understand privacy - even what we mean by "individuals" who want it - requires a contrary opinion. Privacy is honored in lip service, but not in the marketplace, where it is violated every day. To confront the challenges of technological change, we have to know what is happening to "us" so we can re-imagine what we mean by privacy, security, and identity. We can't say what we can't think. We need new language to grasp our own new "human nature" that has been reconstituted from elements like orange juice.<br><br>
      The weakest link in discussions of privacy is the definition of privacy, and the definition of privacy is not what we think. Buddhists call enlightenment a "nightmare in daylight", yet it is enlightenment still, and that kind of clarity is the goal of this presentation.</p>

      <p class="abstract">In response to public security breaches many retailers have begun efforts to minimize or completely prevent the transmission of unencrypted credit card data through their store networks and point of sale systems. While this is definitely a great improvement over the previous state of affairs; it places the security of transactions squarely in the hands of credit card terminals purchased from third party vendors. These terminals have a security posture that is often not well understood by the retail chains purchasing them. To better understand if the trust placed in these devices is warranted, the attack surface and hardening of a commonly deployed credit card terminal series is reviewed and a discussion of reverse engineered security APIs is presented. Despite the reduced attack surface of the terminals and hardened configuration, attacks that allow recovery of magstripe track data and PIN codes are demonstrated to be possible.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Orange Tsai, Security Consultant from DEVCORE</p>
      <p class="datetime">Friday at 12:00 in Track 3 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit</p>
      <p class="abstract">We propose a new exploit technique that brings a whole-new attack surface to bypass SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) protections. This is a very general attack approach, in which we used in combination with our own fuzzing tool to discover many 0days in built-in libraries of very widely-used programming languages, including Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, Wget and cURL. The root cause of the problem lies in the inconsistency of URL parsers and URL requesters.<br><br>
      Being a very fundamental problem that exists in built-in libraries, sophisticated web applications such as WordPress (27% of the Web), vBulletin, MyBB and GitHub can also suffer, and 0days have been discovered in them via this technique. This general technique can also adapt to various code contexts and lead to protocol smuggling and SSRF bypassing. Several scenarios will be demonstrated to illustrate how URL parsers can be exploited to bypass SSRF protection and achieve RCE (Remote Code Execution), which is the case in our GitHub Enterprise demo.<br><br>
      Understanding the basics of this technique, the audience won't be surprised to know that more than 20 vulnerabilities have been found in famous programming languages and web applications aforementioned via this technique.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Images, videos and other digital media provide a convenient and expressive way to communicate through social networks. But such broadcastable and information-rich content provides ample illicit opportunity as well. Web-prevalent image files like JPEGs can be disguised with foreign data since they're perceivably robust to minor pixel and metadata alterations. Slipping a covert message into one of the billions of daily posted images may be possible, but to what extent can steganography be systematically automated and scaled?<br><br>
      To explore this, we first report the distorting side effects rendered upon images uploaded to popular social network servers, e.g. compression, resizing, format conversion, and metadata stripping. Then, we build a convolutional neural network that learns to reverse engineer these transformations by optimizing hidden data throughput capacity. From pre-uploaded and downloaded image files, the network learns to locate candidate metadata and pixels that are least modifiable during transit, allowing stored hidden payloads to be reliably recalled from newly presented images. Deep learning typically requires tons of training data to avoid over fitting. But data acquisition is trivial using social networks' free image hosting services, which feature bulk uploads and downloads of thousands of images at a time per album.<br><br>
      We show that hidden data can be predictably transmitted through social network images with high fidelity. Our results demonstrate that AI can hide data in plain sight, at large-scale, beyond human visual discernment, and despite third-party manipulation. Steganalysis and other defensive forensic countermeasures are notoriously difficult, and our exfiltration techniques highlight the growing threat posed by automated, AI-powered red teaming.</p>

      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 12:00 in Track 2 -- 45 minutes | Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">In this presentation I start off asking the question "How come there are only a handful of BSD security kernel bugs advisories released every year?" and then proceed to try and look at some data from several sources. It should come as no surprise that those sources are fairly limited and somewhat outdated.<br><br>
      The presentation then moves on to try and collect some data ourselves. This is done by actively investigating and auditing. Code review, fuzzing, runtime testing on all 3 major BSD distributions [NetBSD/OpenBSD/FreeBSD]. This is done by first investigating what would be good places where the bugs might be. Once determined, a detailed review is performed of these places. Samples and demos will be shown.<br><br>
      I end the presentation with some results and conclusions. I will list what the outcome was in terms of bugs found, and who -based on the data I now have- among the 3 main BSD distributions can be seen as the clear winner and loser. I will go into detail about the code quality observed and give some pointers on how to improve some code.

      <p class="abstract">Today there is practically a year-round CTF circuit, on which teams hone their skills, win prizes and attain stature. For many, the ultimate goal is to dominate in the utmost competition, DEF CON's CTF, and walk away with a coveted black badge. Capture-the-Flag (CTF) is one of DEF CON's oldest contests, dating back to DEF CON 4. Over the past decades, the perennial contest has matured into an annual event requiring months of preparation and nearly continuous dedication both of players and organizers. Organizers strive to make the events unique while taking extreme measures to prevent games from being gamed. Participants often have to cope with novel challenges while simultaneously demonstrating continued excellence in domains like reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, digital forensics, cryptography, and network security. In this session, we will present the evolution of DEF CON CTF, highlighting key points of advancement in the CTF culture - most of which broke new ground and are now present in other contests run around the world. Capitalizing on the multi-year tenure of recent DEF CON CTF organizers, we are able to concisely represent over 20 years of organizers on a single panel. Where else can you ask cross-generational questions about challenges of running CTF?  Where else can you inquire about evolutionary design, and get answers from those that actually did it?  Where else can you ask about hidden challenges, secrets, and CTF lore...from whom it originated?<br><br>
      The panelists represent over 20 years of DEF CON CTF organizers. Staples in the CTF community are present comprising of decades of experience in participating and organizing CTFs. On stage we have past organizers representing Legit BS, DDTEK, Kenshoto, Ghetto Hackers, and before — many of which also participated as part of top recurring teams such as Sk3wl of r00t, Ghetto Hackers, Samurai, and Team Awesome. Many also played some role (infrastructure, challenge author, announcer) in the Cyber Grand Challenge culminating last summer at DEF CON. They have received and distributed dozens of black badges. Panelists and the roles they represent for this panel: Hawaii John, Legit Business Syndicate; Chris Eagle, DDTEK; Invisigoth, Kenshoto; Caezar, Ghetto Hackers; Myles, Goon.</p>
      <p class="speakerBio">Vulc@n have been involved in the community since DEF CON 11, which in some ways seems recent but upon reflection is clearly more than a decade ago. In his early years he sprinted from talk to talk, dodging curious things like mid-school aged folks with baby chickens, couches in purple-dyed pools, and real dunk tanks. He even sat through talks in the blistering heat in outdoor tents at Alexis Park. Starting with his second year attending, he was pulled more and more into the CTF contest with then new-found and now lifelong friends at Sk3wl of r00t. Much of his time in the years since has been dedicated to playing in CTF or organizing it (as part of DDTEK). Ever since convincing one of his college professors to finance my first DEF CON trip, the hacker scene has been kind to him. He now finds himself in possession of two black badges (and leather jacket). More recently he was part of the Cyber Grand Challenge development team and was an on-stage referees for the all-computer hacking competition this past summer. In summary, it seems that he just keeps finding novel ways to be very involved with DEF CON and CTF.<br>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">Offensive Malware Analysis: Dissecting OSX/FruitFly via a Custom C&amp;C Server</h2>
      <p class="speaker">Patrick Wardle, Chief Security Researcher, Synack / Creator of Objective-See</p>
      <p class="datetime">Friday at 10:20 in 101 Track -- 20 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="abstract">Creating a custom command and control (C&amp;C) server for someone else's malware has a myriad of benefits. If you can take over it a domain, you then may able to fully hijack other hackers' infected hosts. A more prosaic benefit is expediting analysis. While hackers and governments may be more interested in the former, malware analysts can benefit from the later <br><br>
      FruitFly, the first OS X/macOS malware of 2017, is a rather intriguing specimen. Selectively targeting biomedical research institutions, it is thought to have flown under the radar for many years. In this talk, we'll focus on the 'B' variant of FruitFly that even now, is only detected by a handful of security products.<br><br>
      We'll begin by analyzing the malware's dropper, an obfuscated perl script. As this language is rather archaic and uncommon in malware droppers, we'll discuss some debugging techniques and fully deconstruct the script.<br><br>
      While this dropper component also communicates with the C&amp;C server and supports some basic commands, it drops a binary payload in order to perform more complex actions. However, instead of fully reversing this piece of the malware, the talk will focus on an initial triage and show how this was sufficient for the creation of a custom C&amp;C server. With such a server, we can easily coerce the malware to reveal it's full capabilities. For example, the malware invokes a handful of low-level mouse &amp; graphics APIs, passing in a variety of dynamic parameters. Instead of spending hours reversing and debugging this complex code, via the C&amp;C server, we can simply send it various commands and observe the effects.<br><br>
      Of course this approach hinges on the ability to closely observe the malware's actions. As such, we'll discuss macOS-specific tools that can monitor various events, and where necessary detail the creation of custom ones (e.g. a 'mouse sniffer' that locally observes and decodes commands sent from the malware to the OS, in order to control the mouse).<br><br>
      While some of this talk is FruitFly and/or macOS specific, conceptually it should broadly apply to analyzing other malware, even on other operating systems :)</p>

      <p class="speaker">Patrick Wardle, Chief Security Researcher, Synack</p>
      <p class="datetime">Friday at 14:00 in Track 2 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Exploit</p>
      <p class="abstract">Ever get an uneasy feeling when an installer asks for your password? Well, your gut was right! The majority of macOS installers &amp; updaters are vulnerable to a wide range of priv-esc attacks.<br><br>
      It began with the discovery that Apple's OS updater could be abused to bypass SIP (CVE-2017-6974). Next, turns out Apple's core installer app may be subverted to load unsigned dylibs which may elevate privileges to root.<br><br>
      And what about 3rd-party installers? I looked at what's installed on my Mac, and ahhh, so many bugs! <br><br>
      Firewall, Little Snitch: EoP via race condition of insecure plist<br>Anti-Virus, Sophos: EoP via hijack of binary component <br>Browser, Google Chrome: EoP via script hijack<br>Virtualization, VMWare Fusion: EoP via race condition of insecure script<br>IoT, DropCam: EoP via hijack of binary component<br>and more!<br><br>
      ...and 3rd-party auto-update frameworks like Sparkle -yup vulnerable too!<br><br>
      Though root is great, we can't bypass SIP nor load unsigned kexts. However with root, I discovered one could now trigger a ring-0 heap-overflow that provides complete system control.<br><br>
      Though the talk will discuss a variety of discovery mechanisms, 0days, and macOS exploitation techniques, it won't be all doom &amp; gloom. We'll end by discussing ways to perform authorized installs/upgrades that don't undermine system security."</p>

    <h2 class="talkTitle">If You Give a Mouse a Microchip... It will execute a payload and cheat at your high-stakes video game tournament</h2>
      <p class="speaker">skud (Mark Williams), Embedded Software Engineer </p>
      <p class="datetime">Saturday at 11:00 in Track 3 -- 45 minutes | Demo</p>
      <p class="speaker">Sky (Rob Stanley), Security Software Engineer, Lead</p>
      <p class="abstract">The International, a recent esports tournament, had a 20 million dollar prize pool with over five million people tuned in to the final match. The high stakes environment at tournaments creates an incentive for players to cheat for a competitive advantage. Cheaters are always finding new ways to modify software, from attempting to sneak executables in on flash drives, to using cheats stored in Steam's online workshop which bypasses IP restrictions.<br><br>
      This presentation describes how one can circumvent existing security controls to sneak a payload (game cheat) onto a target computer. Esports tournaments typically allow players to provide their own mouse and keyboard, as these players prefer to use specific devices or may be obligated to use a sponsor branded device. These "simple" USB input devices can still be used to execute complex commands on a computer via the USB Human Interface Device (HID) protocol.<br><br>
      Our attack vector is a mouse with an ARM Cortex M series processor. The microcontroller stores custom user profiles in flash memory, allowing the mouse to retain user settings between multiple computers. We modify the device's firmware to execute a payload delivery program, stored in free space in flash memory, before returning the mouse to its original functionality. Retaining original functionality allows the mouse to be used discreetly, as it is an "expected" device at these tournaments. This concept applies to any USB device that uses this processor, and does not require obvious physical modifications.<br><br>
      This delivery method has tradeoffs. Our exploit is observable, as windows are created and in focus during payload delivery. The advantage to this approach is that it bypasses other security measures that are commonly in place, such as filtered internet traffic and disabled USB mass storage.</p>

      <p class="speaker">Matt Wixey, Senior Associate, PwC</p>
      <p class="datetime">Thursday at 14:00 in 101 Track 2 -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
      <p class="abstract">Traditional techniques for C2 channels, exfiltration, surveillance, and exploitation are often frustrated by the growing sophistication and prevalence of security protections, monitoring solutions, and controls. Whilst all is definitely not lost, from an attacker's perspective - we constantly see examples of attackers creatively bypassing such protections - it is always beneficial to have more weapons in one's arsenal, particularly when coming up against heavily-defended networks and highly-secured environments.<br><br>
      This talk demonstrates a number of techniques and attacks which leverage light and/or sound, using off-the-shelf hardware. It covers everything from C2 channels and exfiltration using light and near-ultrasonic sound, to disabling and disrupting motion detectors; from laser microphones, to repelling drones; from trolling friends, to jamming speech and demotivating malware analysts.<br><br>
      This talk not only provides attendees with a new suite of techniques and methodologies to consider when coming up against a well-defended target, but also demonstrates, in a hopefully fun and practical way, how these techniques work, their advantages, disadvantages, and possible future developments. It also gives details of real case studies where some of these techniques have been used, and provides defenders with realistic methods for the mitigation of these attacks.<br><br>
      Finally, the talk covers some ideas for future research in this area.</p>

      <p class="abstract">Do you have a collection of vulnerable programs that you have not yet been able to exploit? There may yet still be hope. This talk will show you how to look deeper (lower level). If you've ever heard experts say how x86 assembly language is just a one-to-one relationship to its machine-code, then we need to have a talk. This is that talk; gruesome detail on how an assembly instruction can have multiple valid representations in machine-code and vice versa. You can also just take my word for it, ignore the details like a bro, and use the tool that will be released for this talk: the Interactive Redundant Assembler (irasm). You can just copy the alternate machine code from the tool and use it in other tools like mona, use it to give yourself more options for self-modifying code, fork Hydan (stego) and give it more variety, or to create peace on earth.</p>

He feeds complete garbage to forensic tools, AV products, decompression software, and intrusion detection systems. He made evil strings more evil (with automation) to exploit high consumption regular expressions. Lately he has been declaring war on assembly language (calling it too high-level) and doing all kinds of ignorant things with machine code. More information can be found on xlogicx.net<br>

      <p class="speaker">Luke Young, Senior Information Security Engineer, LinkedIn</p>
      <p class="datetime">Thursday at 10:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit</p>
      <p class="abstract">Most people lock their doors at night, however if you walk into someone's home you likely won't find every piece of furniture bolted to the floor as well. We trust that if someone is inside our home they are supposed to be there. Unfortunately many developers treat local networks just the same, assuming all internal HTTP traffic is trusted, however this is not always the case. They incorrectly assume that their services will be protected by the same-origin policy in browsers, rather than implementing proper authentication mechanisms. By abusing this implicit trust we can gain access to confidential data and internal services which are not intended to be publicly accessible.<br><br>
      I will demonstrate that this is a poor security control and can be trivially bypassed via an older technique, DNS rebinding. The talk will cover how DNS rebinding works, the mitigations imposed by modern browsers and networks, and how each mitigation can be bypassed. I will discuss the notorious unreliability of DNS rebinding attacks that causes many developers to ignore the issue and how to overcome this unreliability.<br><br>
      Finally, I will examine a variety of popular services and tools to understand how they are affected by DNS rebinding. I will be releasing a tool that allows researchers to automate DNS rebinding attacks, the associated mitigation bypasses and generate drop-dead simple proof-of-concept exploits. I will demonstrate this tool by developing exploits for each vulnerable service, ending the talk by exploiting a vulnerable service to obtain remote-code execution, live. </p>

      <p class="speaker">Zardus (Yan Shoshitaishvili), Assitant Professor, Arizona State University</p>
      <p class="datetime">Sunday at 15:00 in 101 Track -- 45 minutes | Hacker History, Demo</p>
      <p class="abstract">Last year, DARPA hosted the Cyber Grand Challenge, the culmination of humanity's research into autonomous detection, exploitation, and mitigation of software vulnerabilities. Imagine the CGC from the outside: huge racks of servers battling it out on stage, throwing exploit after exploit at each other while humans watch helplessly from the sidelines. But that vantage point misses the program analysis methods used, the subtle trade-offs made, and the actual capabilities of these systems. It also misses why, outside of the controlled CGC environment, most automated techniques don't quite scale to the analysis of real-world software!<br><br>
      This talk will provide a better perspective. On the 25th anniversary of DEFCON, we will go through these last 25 years of program analysis. We'll learn about the different disciplines of program analysis (and learn strange terms such as static, dynamic, symbolic, and abstract), understand the strength and drawbacks of each, and see if, and to what extent, they are used in the course of actual vulnerability analysis.<br><br>
      Did you know that every finalist system in the Cyber Grand Challenge used a combination of dynamic analysis and symbolic execution to find vulnerabilities, but used static analysis to patch them? Why is that? Did you know that, to make the contest feasible for modern program analysis techniques, the CGC enforced a drastically-simplified OS model? What does this mean for you, if you want to use program analysis while finding vulns and collecting bug bounties? Come to this talk, become an expert, and go on to contribute to the future of program analysis!</p>

      <p class="abstract">Kernel bug is always very difficult to reproduce and may lead to the entire system panic and restart. In practice, kernel debugging is the only way to analyze panic scenes. However, implementing such a technique in real world is not an easy task since kernel code cannot be executed in the debugger, thus is hard to be tracked. Luckily, macOS has provided a very powerful kernel debugging mechanism, KDK (Kernel Development Kit), to assist people to analyze and develop kernel exploits. While for iOS, although there is no official kernel debugger, it is also possible for us to achieve kernel debugging by leveraging some tricks.<br><br>
      In this talk, we will share some kernel debugging techniques and their corresponding tricks on the latest iOS/macOS. In addition, we will also introduce the new kernel heap mitigation mechanisms on iOS 10/macOS 10.12 and two heap feng shui techniques to bypass them. Finally, we will demonstrate how to debug a concrete kernel heap overflow bug and then leverage our new heap feng shui techniques to gain arbitrary kernel memory read/write on the iOS 10.2/macOS 10.12.</p>

      <p class="abstract">One vulnerability in CSFB (Circuit Switched Fallback) in 4G LTE network will be presented. In the CSFB procedure, we found the authentication step is missing. This results in that an attacker can hijack the victim's communication. We named this attack as 'Ghost Telephonist'. Several exploitations can be made based on this vulnerability. When the call or SMS is not encrypted, or weakly encrypted, the attacker can impersonate the victim to receive the "Mobile Terminated" calls and messages or to initiate the "Mobile Originated" calls and messages. Furthermore, Telephonist Attack can obtain the victim's phone number and then use the phone number to make advanced attack, e.g. breaking Internet online accounts. These attacks can randomly choose victims, or target a given victim. We verified these attack with our own phones in operators' network in a small controllable scale. The experiments proved the vulnerability really exists. The attack doesn't need fake base station so the attack cost is low. The victim doesn't sense being attacked since no fake base station and no cell re-selection. Now we are collaborating with operators and terminal manufactures to fix this vulnerability.</p>
