# Talks for DefCon 2017 (25)

## What is this

These are all the presentation notes for DefCon 25.

## How did you do this thing

These were taken from https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-25/dc-25-speakers.html and reformatted to HTML for easy consumption, as well as Kindle format for easy reading on the plane ride over.

I used [Kindle Previewer 3](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1003018611&sa-no-redirect=1) to preview the HTML & CSS for this document, and the native "Export" function to generate the .mobi file. This was helpful in that it let me catch the non-English characters that I needed to change to Unicode, and I also made some formatting changes to tighten the Speaker Bio's up a little bit.

## What do I do with this

The DefCon 25 Schedule is [located here](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-25/dc-25-schedule.html) and is still very compicated to render. My usual tactic is to get the paper schedule that comes with the bag, circle the talks I want to go to, and highlight the ones I can actually make it to.

## Todo

Next year, I would like to add a Table Of Contents to the file, to make Kindling easier. However, Bookmarks and Highlights can still be used to note which talks seem interesting, so they can be found on the schedule.

Happy DefCon!
